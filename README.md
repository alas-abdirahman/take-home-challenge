# take-home-challenge
I successfully completed the challenge of creating a simple React application that displays a list of beneficiaries with their avatar, full name, mobile number, and target group information. The application allows users to search for beneficiaries by name and filter the list based on target groups using checkboxes. I also created a Node.js API that serves the beneficiary data to the frontend from a JSON source.

Ideas for Future Improvements:
If I had more time to work on this application, here are some ideas for further enhancements:

Authentication and User Management: Implement a user authentication system to secure the application and allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their beneficiaries.

Pagination: Implement pagination for the beneficiary list to improve performance and user experience, especially when dealing with a large number of beneficiaries.

Sorting and Filtering: Provide additional options for sorting the beneficiary list based on different criteria such as name, mobile number, or target group. Allow users to apply multiple filters simultaneously.

Image Upload: Allow users to upload their own avatar images for beneficiaries instead of relying solely on placeholder images. Implement server-side image processing and storage.

Data Persistence: Integrate a database system such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store the beneficiary data persistently, allowing for data updates and retrieval across multiple sessions.

Improved UI/UX: Enhance the user interface and overall user experience by refining the design, adding animations, and providing clear visual cues for search and filter functionalities.

Deployment and Continuous Integration: Set up a deployment pipeline using platforms like Heroku, Netlify, or AWS to automatically deploy the application and enable continuous integration with version control systems like GitHub.

By implementing these improvements, the application will become more robust, user-friendly, and scalable, providing a better experience for both beneficiaries and administrators.
